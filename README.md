# roku

Simple script with crappy ASCII-ish menu for numeric keypads to manage roku.

Works great for me.  Give it a shot and let me know what your take is.

## To-do

* Prefer curses style layout but don't exactly know the best approach - suggestions welcome
* Create a class instead perhaps albeit it doesn't matter much
* Make it possibly web page friendly so I don't have to worry about it being pretty.
